# Basic Vue.js Website

> A Vue.js project

## Description
Trying out some basic Vue routing and link animations + component nesting.
Resizing the page dynamically changes layout of grid objects.

## Next Steps
- Make resizing the page not break everything :)
- Move objects around to better fit depending on display width
- Add more content
- No hard-coded tab names/links (source of truth in component data)
- Dynamic component generation
- more interesting side bar info

## Build Setup

``` bash
# install dependencies
npm install

# serve with hot reload at localhost:8080
npm run dev

# build for production with minification
npm run build

# build for production and view the bundle analyzer report
npm run build --report
```
