# Basic Vue.js Website

> A basic website with Vue.js

## Description
Trying out some basic Vue routing and link animations + component nesting.
Resizing the page dynamically changes layout of grid objects.

## Next Steps
- ~~Make resizing the page not break everything~~
- ~~Move objects around to better fit depending on display width~~
- Add more content
- No hard-coded tab names/links (source of truth in component data)
- Dynamic component generation
- more interesting side bar info
- better navigation buttons in mobile view

## Build Setup

``` bash
# install dependencies
npm install

# serve with hot reload at localhost:8080
npm run dev
```

Boilerplate used is vue webpack: http://vuejs-templates.github.io/webpack
